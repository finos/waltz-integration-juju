# FINOS Waltz Juju EC2 deployment - Periodic refresh

The [Refresh EC2 FINOS Waltz deployment](../.github/workflows/refresh_deployment.yaml) job will run periodically for a configured Juju EC2 deployment and will refresh the Waltz and Ingress charms to their latest revision. This job requires a few Secrets to be defined in the project repository (`Settings > Secrets > Actions > Repository secrets` or using the `gh secret set` command):

- `SSH_USER`: The username to use when connecting to the EC2 instance.
- `SSH_HOST`: The hostname of the EC2 instance.
- `SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key to use when connecting to the EC2 instance.

Once the above repository secrets have been set, the job should succeed. A manual job can also be triggered by going to `Actions > Refresh EC2 FINOS Waltz deployment > Run workflow`.

The Github CLI commands for setting the secrets are:

```bash
gh -R finos/waltz-integration-juju secret set SSH_USER
gh -R finos/waltz-integration-juju secret set SSH_HOST
gh -R finos/waltz-integration-juju secret set SSH_KEY < ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The CLI will prompt you to paste the `SSH_USER` and `SSH_HOST` secrets in the terminal, while `SSH_KEY` will load the private key from the specified location.
